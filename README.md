# Mixed_Gambling_Task, NARPS replication Study
#======================================================================================
-Mistakes with NARPS: 

1- you did not connect McFlirt to rest of pipeline 

2- you did not account for negative activation by putting [-1] mean for the two groups

#Corrected alread and the code has been updated, level 3 design now contains [-1 0], [0 -1]

3- you used cope in place of zstat in 3rd_level_post_fitting script 

#Corrected already and the code has been updated to use zstat instead and moreover account for 
the new added negative copes
